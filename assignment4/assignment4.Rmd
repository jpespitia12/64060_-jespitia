## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#This will run the k means to cluster the cars - we have told it to do it in 5 clusters

fviz_cluster(k5, data = pharmaData1df)
#Shows the 5 clusters and whats inside of them

cluster1 <- data.frame(pharmaData1df[c(1,3,4,7,10,16,19,21),])
cluster2 <- data.frame(pharmaData1df[c(11,13,15,17),])
cluster3 <- data.frame(pharmaData1df[c(2,18),])
cluster4 <- data.frame(pharmaData1df[c(5,9,14,20),])
cluster5 <- data.frame(pharmaData1df[c(6,8,12),])

#B. The interpretation is that 
#cluster 1 has high net profit margin, low revenue growth
#cluster 2 has the highest market cap, high ROE, high ROA, 
#cluster 3 has the highest PE ratio
#cluster 4 has highest revenue growth, low market cap, low asset turnover
#cluster 5 has highest leverage, low net profit margin,
