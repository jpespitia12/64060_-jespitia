## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
# 
# install.packages("class")
library(class)
#  install.packages("caret")
library(caret)
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# install.packages("FNN")
library(FNN)
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
# install.packages("esquisse")
# library("esquisse")
# install.packages("gmodels")
library(gmodels)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#2. k = 3 as we saw in the accuaracy data frame with an accuracy of .9590
#3. matrix is shown
#4This customer will be accepted for a personal loan (output = 1)
