## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Question A
# Shows a pivot table as described in question A of the column variable being online
# and credit card as a row variable and as a secondary row variable it is loan
# this can be seen from the output of the code

#Question B
#Loan acceptance = 1, CC = 1, Online = 1
#If we look at the table we can see that there is 511 records where Online=1 and CC=1. 465+46=511
# Out of those 511 records we can see that 46 of those people accepted the loan. The probability is 46/511 which = .090 which is the same as 9%

#Question C
meltbank <- melt(bankdata.tr, id=c("CreditCard","Personal.Loan"), variable = "Online")
castbank <- dcast(meltbank, CreditCard+Personal.Loan~Online)
castbank[,c(1:3)]
#This gets a data frame and makes it so that the variable is online - In the DF we can see how online is affected by personal loan & Credit cards

meltbank1 <- melt(bankdata.tr, id = c("Personal.Loan"), variable = "Online")
meltbank2 <- melt(bankdata.tr, id = c("CreditCard"), variable = "Online")
# melt function will help me decide what is the variable and help me create the 2 pivot tables to show that

castbank1 <- dcast(meltbank1, Personal.Loan~Online)
castbank1[,c(1,2)]
# View(castbank1[,c(1,2)])

#This is the first pivot table which shows the relationship as asked in question C, which is relationship between the personal loan and online.

castbank2 <- dcast(meltbank2, CreditCard~Online)
castbank2[,c(1,3)]
# View(castbank2[,c(1,3)])

#This is the second pivot table from question C, This shows the relationship between credit card and online.

ftable(bankdata.tr[,c(3,1)])
#This shows me how to answer question D (I and IV)
#Question I -  In the table you can see the probability is 81 with CC=1 and Loan=1 - the total of that personal loan = 288. 81/288 = .28 = 28%

#Question IV - CC=1 and Loan=0 is equal to 789. The total of loans that are not accepted is 2712. 789/2712 = .29 = 29%

ftable(bankdata.tr[,c(2,1)])
#This shows me how to answer question D (II and V)
#Question II -  In the table you can see the probability is 172 with Online=1 and Loan=1 - the total of that personal loan = 288. 172/288 = .6 = 60%

#Question V - Online=1 and Loan=0 is equal to 1613. The total of loans that are not accepted (loan=0) is 2712. 1613/2712 = .59 = 595

ftable(bankdata.tr[,c(1)])
#This shows me how to answer question D (III and VI)
#Question III -  In the table you can see the probability is 288 people who accepted the loan (loan=1). The total of that personal loan = 3000. 288/3000 = .096 = 9.6%. This makes sense and is correct because as stated in the question it already gave us the information (9.6% acceptance rate) we are just confirming it

#Question VI = Loan=0 is equal to 2712. 2712/3000 = .904 = 90.4%


#TheNaive Bayes Formula as seen in the modules is: P(Y|X) = P(X|Y)P(Y)/P(X)
#For question E the model goes like this: P(Loan=1|CC=1,Online=1) 
#From the results in the other question we can easily input those results to calculate the naive bayes probability
#We already have the results for cc=1|loan=1 is.28 online=1|Loan=1 is.6. P(Loan=1) is .096
#so now we have (.28)(.6)(.096)/(.28)(.6)(.096)+(.29)(.59)(.904) = .016/.016+.155 = .016/.171

#Question E Answer
#For the final answer that I calculated of .093 = 9.3%

#Question F - I do not really know how to tell which one is more accurate, what do I compare it too? But based on the lecture, I would say pivot table B because, the one con of Naive Bayes is that it assumes that ll predictors are independent. This means that pivot table B is more accurate because in a real life scenario I do not think its possible for the predictors to be independent, and this is where in pivot table B the relationship between the predictors stay.


bankdata.nb <- naive_bayes(Personal.Loan~., data = bankdata.tr)
bankdata.nb

#Question G - Here we can see that the outcome is the same .096 = 9.6% which is out of those 5000 customers only 9.6% accepted the loan

```
